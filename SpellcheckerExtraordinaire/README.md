My humble attempt at solving coding challenges in the programming language "go", that I started learning yesterday.  
As such, expect little adherence to best practices.  
The solutions are self-contained and no attempt at code reusability is made, as it is impossible to predict which code may need to be reused at a later puzzle.  
  
A solution can be run by executing ```go run .``` from within the solution directory.  
All solutions can be run one by one by executing the same command in the top level directory
